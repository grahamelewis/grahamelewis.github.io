In addition to this bio, I will probably have a picture of myself. This picture will have to look somewhat professional. I don't see the utility in having too many words on this page so I will probably leave it here for now.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
