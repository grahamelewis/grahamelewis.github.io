Some techniques are best conveyed with examples and practice problems, others are suited more for detailed explanation and analysis. All lessons require careful preparation. A central component of my teaching style is reinforcement, I strive to create an engaging classroom where students have multiple passes through each concept. This is enhanced through visual representations, intuitive explanations, and practice problems.\nProbably another paragraph."
